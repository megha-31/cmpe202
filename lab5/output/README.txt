Following observations were made during my visit at Five Guys Burger:

1. 1 person was at the counter receiving the order and payment
2. Post payment the preparation for order began
3. There was a Buns counter where the assigned person was preparing bun and adding toppings if any.
4. There was a separate counter for Patties and a person was assigned to prepare patties in parallel
5. Likewise there was a separate counter and an assigned person for the perparation of fries.
6. 1 person was responsible for assembling the final order. He received bun, patty and fries from the 3 counters and prepared the final order

During my visit only 5 people were involved in the entire process. But I spoke to the person at the Counter and he informed me that it's not always 5 and the number of people might exceed 5 and is not constant.
